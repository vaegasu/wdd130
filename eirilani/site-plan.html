    </p>
    <h3>Why will people come to your site?</h3>
    <p>I want to attract an audience that want to personalize their special events. I want to be able to design whatever
      they might have in mind and bring it right to life for them. It could be as simple as a customized banner with
      their loved ones or customized shirts with their little ones face on it. The possiblity is endeless. I want them
      to be able to come to my site with a vision in mind so that I can bring it to life for them. I want them to see
      how much passion and love I have for designing and being creative. I will also
      include a blog and profortolio section so they can see my work. </p>

    <h3>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</h3>
    <p>A few questions vistors should expect are:<br>What to expect?<br>How much do we charge?<br>How long will the
      process take?<br>Booking Expectations<br>Refund
      Policy<br>Etc..</p>

    <h3>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</h3>
    <p>I will have a lot of designes and color schemes that they can pick and choose from. They can switch up designs
      and colors and play around with it so they can see what they like as far as deisgns and colors. They can leave any
      comments towards the end on how they would want it. I want to make this activity are fun and easy process for my
      visitors. I want them to be excited for what I will design for them. I'll also have a feedback sections where they
      can post their pictures and
      reviews of our designs.</p>

    <h3>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</h3>
    <p>Information that is necessary to complete are:<br>What the vistors wants and expect in detail when it comes to
      their designs, any pictures or personal designs they want me to include, time and date they need will be needing
      it, and down payment. Once product is done, I can ship out once payment is paid in full.</p>

    <h3>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
    </h3>
    <p>My website will be easy to navigate, user friendly for all ages. My website will help vistors get the help and
      answers they need right away. I will have my contact information so they can reach me incase any questions or
      concerns weren't answered. I want to make the process of ordering as easy and comfortable for my vistors.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience would be everyone of all ages, from babies celebrating their one year milestone to mommy's to be
      celebrating gender reveals to old folks entering retirement. I want to target audiences celebrating special
      moments in their life. I want to help families create memories of a life time and keep with them for generations
      to come.</p>
