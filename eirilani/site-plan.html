    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My audience would be everyone of all ages, from babies celebrating their one year milestone to mommy's to be
      celebrating gender reveals to old folks entering retirement. I want to target audiences celebrating special
      moments in their life. I want to help families create memories of a life time and keep with them for generations
      to come.</p>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/ddc1d8-f2f9f7-c3a4ae-6c6464"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/ddc1d8-f2f9f7-c3a4ae-6c6464</a>

        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
