    <h2>Vae Gasu</h2>
    <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
    <p>My name is Vaeulatoifaga Gasu, I go by Vae (Vi). I am married to my handsome husband, Sefa Gasu and we have two
        beautiful daughters, Eirike and Leilani. I was born and raised in Long Beach, California. My little family and I
        recently moved to Utah. It's different from what I am used to but I love it here. I love spending time with my
        loved ones, traveling to new places and trying new foods. I am a stay at home momma to my baby girls. I decided
        to go back to school and pursue a career in Technology. It's something about it that fascinates me a lot. I've
        worked in Administration for 7 years, I know the basic functions but that's pretty much it. I love to be
        creative and I can see myself enjoying a career in this field. I know I have a lot to learn and I am prepared to
        work hard in my studies.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church for six years. I didn't know anything about the church or mormons until I met my
        husband who had returned from his mission back in 2013. I was blessed to have my husband baptize me. He loves to
        tell everyone how we met and that he fell in love with a convert. I am truly thankful for Heavenly Father and
        His gospel. Becoming a member and choosing to be baptized was one of the best decisions I made. </p>
    <p>Thank you for looking at my web page. I look forward to a great semester with you all. â˜º</p>
